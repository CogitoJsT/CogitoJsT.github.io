# Issue
모두를 위한 딥러닝 강의를 들으며 tensorflow 코드를 실행시키니 error 가 발생하면서 정상적으로 실행이 되지 않음.
<br>
<br>

# Code
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()

X = [1, 2, 3]
Y = [1, 2, 3]

W = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32)

hypothesis = X * W

cost = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(hypothesis - Y))
sess = tf.compat.v1.Session()
sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())

W_val = []
cost_val = []
for i in range(-30, 50):
    feed_w = i * 0.1
    curr_cost, curr_W = sess.run([cost, W], feed_dict={W: feed_w})
    W_val.append(curr_W)
    cost_val.append(curr_cost)

plt.plot(W_val, cost_val)
plt.show()
```

# error
```
OMP: Error #15: Initializing libiomp5md.dll, but found libiomp5 already initialized.
OMP: Hint This means that multiple copies of the OpenMP runtime have been linked into the program. That is dangerous, since it can degrade performance or cause incorrect results. The best thing to do is to ensure that only a single OpenMP runtime is 
linked into the process, e.g. by avoiding static linking of the OpenMP runtime in any library. As an unsafe, unsupported, undocumented workaround you can set the environment variable KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE to allow the program to continue to execute, but that may cause crashes or silently produce incorrect results. For more information, please see http://www.intel.com/software/products/support/.

# Solution
아래와 같은 코드를 넣으주니 정상적으로 동작

```python
import os
os.environ["KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK"] = "TRUE"
```
